            <p>Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a way to understand the environmental impact of a product, building, or service from the moment it’s made to the moment it's no longer used. It looks at every stage of its life, from gathering materials, production, use, and disposal.</p>
            <p>LCA is used to measure things like energy use, waste created, or pollution produced at each of these stages. This helps people and companies make better choices about how to create more eco-friendly products.</p>
            <p>By using LCA, we can identify ways to reduce waste, save energy, and use resources wisely, which all help in creating a more sustainable and healthier planet.</p>

            <h2>Example: LCA for Steel and Concrete</h2>
            <p>Imagine you're building a house using steel and concrete. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) helps you understand the full environmental impact of these materials.</p>
            <p><strong>For steel</strong>, the LCA starts with mining iron ore, then the energy and resources needed to turn it into steel, transport it to your site, and use it in your building. It also looks at how the steel might be reused or recycled when the building is no longer in use.</p>
            <p><strong>For concrete</strong>, it considers the production of cement (a key ingredient), which releases a lot of carbon dioxide, the energy used to mix and pour the concrete, and what happens to it after demolition—can it be reused or does it end up in a landfill?</p>
            <p>By looking at the LCA for both steel and concrete, builders can choose materials that have less environmental impact. For example, recycled steel might be a better option, or finding ways to reduce the amount of concrete needed. This way, LCA helps reduce the overall carbon footprint of the building and makes it more sustainable in the long run.</p>
