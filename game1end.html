            The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 goals created by the United Nations to make the world a better place by 2030. Sustainability isn't just about taking care of the environment. It's about a balance between three things: the environment, the economy, and society. These goals are important because they help countries work together to solve big problems while protecting nature, supporting people's well-being, and ensuring fair opportunities for everyone, both now and in the future. Itâ€™s a holistic view that looks at the big picture.
